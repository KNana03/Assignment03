This is the asssignment I did for one of my modules in 2024. The module was INF354. The frontend was coded
in Angular and the backend was coded in C#. The web app that I created was an online shop. There is authentication
included, in the form of a login and regsiter page.

To run the app, in the terminal in VSCode for the frontend, you need to install node modules, which can be installed
by using "npm install" or "npm install -g @angular/cli).

The backend you will need to change the source for the database in the appsettings.json file in order to read and write from the
database. You will also need another token in order for the authentication functionality to work.
